# Confidence level

The 95% confidence level is commonly chosen in statistical analysis and forecasting for several important reasons:

Statistical Standard: It has become a widely accepted standard in statistical practice, offering a balance between:

Being stringent enough to provide reliable predictions
Not being so strict that it becomes impractical for business use

Interpretability: It means we can be 95% confident that the true value will fall within the predicted range, which is:

Easy to explain to stakeholders
Intuitive enough for non-statisticians to understand
Meaningful for business decision-making

Practical Significance: For labor forecasting specifically, 95% confidence:

Provides enough certainty for workforce planning
Allows for reasonable contingency planning
Balances the cost of over-staffing against the risk of under-staffing

Risk Management: In manufacturing labor planning:

95% confidence provides good coverage for normal variations
The remaining 5% accounts for rare events or extreme circumstances
This aligns well with typical manufacturing risk tolerance levels

Historical Precedent: Many business and statistical software packages use 95% as a default, making it:

Easy to compare results across different analyses
Compatible with other business intelligence tools
Consistent with industry practices

Other confidence levels (like 90% or 99%) could be used, but 95% has proven to be a practical choice for business forecasting applications like labor prediction.
