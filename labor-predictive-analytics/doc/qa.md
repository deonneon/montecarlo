# Common Questions and Answers

Q: What is the purpose of this analytics dashboard?
A: The dashboard provides predictive analytics for manufacturing labor hours, combining both aggregate and individual worker-level forecasting. It helps track labor efficiency, predict future labor needs, and analyze patterns across fiscal periods and departments.
Q: What are the main features of the dashboard?
A: The dashboard includes:

Real-time KPI tracking (total hours, labor efficiency, overtime ratio)
Department-level comparisons
Individual worker predictions
Hybrid forecasting system
Fiscal year analysis
Monte Carlo simulations for confidence intervals
Seasonal pattern analysis

Q: How does the hybrid forecasting system work?
A: The hybrid system combines two approaches:

Aggregate-level forecasting using Holt-Winters time series analysis
Individual worker-level predictions using Monte Carlo simulations
These are weighted (default 60% aggregate, 40% worker-level) to produce final predictions.

Q: What departments are tracked in the system?
A: The system tracks several departments including:

Assembly
Quality
Maintenance
Logistics
Management

Q: How does the fiscal year handling work?
A: The system uses a government fiscal year starting in October (Month 10). It automatically:

Calculates fiscal years and periods
Tracks patterns within fiscal periods
Provides year-over-year comparisons
Shows fiscal period trends

Q: What metrics are used to measure labor efficiency?
A: Key efficiency metrics include:

Direct labor ratio
Overtime ratio
Average hours per employee
Labor utilization rate
Department-specific efficiency metrics

Q: How far ahead can the system forecast?
A: The system can generate forecasts for various horizons:

Short-term (5-day) worker-level predictions
Medium-term (30-day) departmental forecasts
Long-term (up to 252 days/full fiscal year) strategic forecasts

Q: How does the system handle seasonality?
A: The system accounts for seasonality through:

Yearly patterns (252 working days)
Weekly patterns (5-day work week)
Fiscal period patterns
Holiday adjustments
Manufacturing-specific seasonal factors

Q: What confidence levels are used in the predictions?
A: The system uses 95% confidence intervals for predictions, showing:

Mean forecast values
Upper bounds
Lower bounds
Monte Carlo simulation ranges

Q: How does the system track overtime?
A: Overtime is tracked through:

Individual worker overtime hours
Department-level overtime ratios
Historical overtime patterns
Overtime prediction modeling
Cost impact analysis

Q: Can the system handle employee growth?
A: Yes, the system includes:

Employee growth rate calculations
Adjustable growth projections
Impact analysis on labor forecasts
Department-specific growth tracking

Q: What historical data is used for predictions?
A: The system uses:

Individual worker histories
Department-level trends
Fiscal year patterns
Seasonal variations
Holiday and special event data

Q: How accurate are the predictions?
A: The system measures accuracy through:

RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) calculations
Confidence interval tracking
Model diagnostics
Historical performance comparison
Hybrid model validation

Q: How does the system handle holidays and special events?
A: The system accounts for:

Federal holidays
Company-specific holidays
Maintenance periods
Month-end activities
Quarter-end patterns
