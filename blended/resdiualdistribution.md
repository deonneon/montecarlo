1. Understand Residual Distributions
   Residuals are the differences between actual values and predicted values:

# Residual

Actual
−
Predicted
Residual=Actual−Predicted
Analyze residuals for each method (Holt-Winters and Monte Carlo):

Trend: Are there any systematic biases (e.g., underestimation or overestimation)?
Variance: How wide is the spread of residuals? Is it stable or time-dependent?
Autocorrelation: Are residuals correlated across time (e.g., persistent patterns of error)? 2. Diagnose Patterns
Perform statistical tests and visualizations:

Histogram or Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) of residuals to check their distribution.
Autocorrelation Function (ACF) plot to identify time-dependence.
Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) Plot to test normality assumptions.
Code Example:

python

import statsmodels.api as sm

# Residuals

hw_residuals = train_data["Total_Hours"] - hw_fit.fittedvalues
mc_residuals = weekly_data["Total_Hours"] - mc_weekly_totals

# Histogram for residuals

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.hist(hw_residuals, bins=30, alpha=0.5, label="HW Residuals")
plt.hist(mc_residuals, bins=30, alpha=0.5, label="MC Residuals")
plt.legend()
plt.title("Residual Distributions")
plt.show()

# ACF Plot

sm.graphics.tsa.plot_acf(hw_residuals, lags=20, title="ACF of HW Residuals")
plt.show()
sm.graphics.tsa.plot_acf(mc_residuals, lags=20, title="ACF of MC Residuals")
plt.show()

# Q-Q Plot

sm.qqplot(hw_residuals, line='s')
plt.title("Q-Q Plot for HW Residuals")
plt.show()
sm.qqplot(mc_residuals, line='s')
plt.title("Q-Q Plot for MC Residuals")
plt.show() 3. Incorporate Residual Characteristics
Use the insights to adjust forecasts dynamically:

A. Dynamic Variance Adjustment
If one model has higher variance, use its residual distribution to expand confidence intervals.
Use residual variance to weight models:
𝛼
=
1
Variance
𝐻
𝑊
/
(
1
Variance
𝐻
𝑊

- 1
  Variance
  𝑀
  𝐶
  )
  α=
  Variance
  HW
  ​

1
​
/(
Variance
HW
​

- Variance
  MC
  ​

)
Adjust the blended forecast and confidence intervals:
python

alpha = 1 / hw*residuals.var() / (1 / hw_residuals.var() + 1 / mc_residuals.var())
blended_forecast = alpha * hw*forecast + (1 - alpha) * mc_weekly_totals

combined*ci_5 = blended_forecast - (1.96 * np.sqrt(hw*residuals.var() + mc_residuals.var()))
combined_ci_95 = blended_forecast + (1.96 * np.sqrt(hw_residuals.var() + mc_residuals.var()))
B. Residual Autocorrelation
If residuals show autocorrelation, integrate them into future forecasts using an ARIMA model.
Example:
python

from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA

residual_model = ARIMA(hw_residuals, order=(1, 0, 0)) # Adjust order based on ACF
residual_fit = residual_model.fit()

# Predict future residuals

future_residuals = residual_fit.forecast(steps=4)

# Adjust blended forecast with predicted residuals

adjusted_forecast = blended_forecast + future_residuals 4. Blend Residuals for Combined Confidence Intervals
Instead of relying solely on Holt-Winters or Monte Carlo for confidence intervals, use residuals to estimate combined uncertainty:

# Combined_CI

Variance
𝐻
𝑊

- Variance
  𝑀
  𝐶
  Combined_CI=
  Variance
  HW
  ​
  +Variance
  MC
  ​

​

Code Example:

python

# Combined variance

combined_variance = hw_residuals.var() + mc_residuals.var()
ci_width = 1.96 \* np.sqrt(combined_variance)

combined_ci_5 = blended_forecast - ci_width
combined_ci_95 = blended_forecast + ci_width 5. Outlier Detection
Identify outlier residuals (e.g., > 2 standard deviations) and flag them for review.
Adjust the final forecast to mitigate their impact (e.g., replacing extreme residuals with the median).
Example:

python

threshold = 2 \* hw_residuals.std()
hw_residuals_clipped = np.clip(hw_residuals, -threshold, threshold)
mc_residuals_clipped = np.clip(mc_residuals, -threshold, threshold)

blended*residuals = alpha * hw*residuals_clipped + (1 - alpha) * mc_residuals_clipped
adjusted_forecast = blended_forecast + blended_residuals 6. Visualize Adjusted Forecasts
Combine all adjustments and visualize final results:

Include historical data, adjusted forecasts, and combined confidence intervals.
Show the contribution of residuals to the adjustments.
python

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(weekly_data.index, adjusted_forecast, label="Adjusted Blended Forecast")
plt.fill_between(
weekly_data.index, combined_ci_5, combined_ci_95, color="gray", alpha=0.3, label="Combined CI"
)
plt.legend()
plt.title("Blended Forecast with Residual Adjustments")
plt.show()
